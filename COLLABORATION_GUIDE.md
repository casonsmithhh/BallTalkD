# BallTalk Collaboration Guide

## How to Share This Project with Your Friend

### Option 1: Using Bolt (Recommended)
Your friend can use Bolt to work on this project too! Here's how:

1. **Share the Project Files:**
   - Copy all the project files from this conversation
   - Send them to your friend via email, Google Drive, or any file sharing method
   - Or create a GitHub repository (see Option 2 below)

2. **Your Friend Opens Bolt:**
   - Go to [bolt.new](https://bolt.new)
   - Start a new project
   - Upload/paste all the project files
   - Bolt will automatically set up the development environment

3. **Both of you can work simultaneously:**
   - Make changes in your respective Bolt instances
   - Share code updates back and forth
   - Coordinate who works on what features

### Option 2: GitHub Repository (Best for Long-term)
Create a GitHub repo so you can both contribute:

1. **Create GitHub Repository:**
   ```bash
   # Create new repo on GitHub.com
   # Then clone and push your code
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial BallTalk project"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/balltalk.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Invite Your Friend:**
   - Go to repository Settings â†’ Collaborators
   - Add your friend's GitHub username
   - They can clone and work on the project

3. **Both Use Bolt:**
   - You can both import the GitHub repo into Bolt
   - Make changes in Bolt
   - Push changes back to GitHub
   - Pull each other's updates

### Option 3: Real-time Collaboration
For real-time collaboration:

1. **VS Code Live Share:**
   - One person hosts a Live Share session
   - Share the session link
   - Both can edit code simultaneously

2. **Bolt + Screen Share:**
   - One person shares their Bolt screen
   - Collaborate in real-time via video call
